## Power Apps


A Power Apps application has been developed for requesting promotional items and materials for events organized by consultants and distributed nationwide across Brazil. This application establishes a direct connection with the company's CRM and utilizes a standardized unified database, enabling the Commercial Operations team to efficiently process orders. This streamlined approach has resulted in a reduction of operational time by over 70%.

## SQL 
# Challenge 1 

**[THE PADS] ( https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-pads/problem)**  

# Result
```SQL 
SELECT CONCAT(NAME, '(', LEFT(OCCUPATION, 1), ')')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY NAME;


SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(OCCUPATION), ' ', LOWER(OCCUPATION), 's.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), LOWER(OCCUPATION);
```

## Python, 

```Python 
### version

!python -V

# 1.3 arrays Numpy

import numpy as np

km = np.loadtxt('carros-km.txt')

km

anos = np.loadtxt('carros-anos.txt', dtype = int)

anos

### Obtaining the average mileage per year

km_media = km / (2022 - anos)

km_media

type(km_media)

```

### Variable declaration


```Python 
ano_atual = 2019
ano_fabricacao = 2003
km_total = 44410.0

Year_Now

manufacturing_year

km_total

# $$km_{averange} = \frac {km_{total}}{(Year_{now} - Year_{manufacturing})}$$

km_media = km_total // (ano_atual - ano_fabricacao)

km_media


### Multiple declaration

current_year = 2019
year_manufactured = 2003
km_total = 44410.0

current_year, manufacturing_year, km_total = 2020 , 2019 , 4888.0

current_year

km_total
